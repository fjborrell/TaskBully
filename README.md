# Task Bully

## Inspiration
Our team really wanted to create a new way to maximize productivity without the interference of modern technology. we often find ourselves reaching for our phones to scroll through social media for just a "5 minute break" which quickly turns into a 2 hours procrastination session. On top of that, we wanted the motivation to be delivered in a sarcastic/funny way. Thus, we developed a task manager app that bullies you into working. 

## What it does
The app allows you to create a to-do list of tasks that you can complete at any time. Once you decide to start a task, distracting yourself with other applications is met with reinforcement to get you back to work. The reinforcement is done through text and sound based notifications. Not everyone is motivated in the same way, thus the intensity of the reinforcement can be calibrated to the user's personal needs. The levels include: Encouragement, Passive-Aggression and Bullying.  

## How we built it
We built the our project as a mobile app using Swift and Apple's SwiftUI and UserNotification frameworks. Development was done via Xcode. The app is optimized for IOS 16. 

## Challenges we ran into
Learning how to code in Swift. Our team did not have a lot of experience in mobile IOS development. Since we were only familiar with the basics, we wanted to include more advanced features that would force us to integrate new modules and frameworks. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having a product we are proud enough to demo. This is the first time anyone in our team is demoing. We spent extra time polishing the design and including animations. We wanted to deliver an App that felt like a complete product, and not just a hack, even if the scope was not very large.  

## What we learned
We learned front end in Swift (SwiftUI) including how to make animations. A lot about data transfer and persistence in IOS applications. And the entire development cycle of building a complete and kick-ass Application. 

## What's next for TaskBully?
- Incorporate a scheduling/deadline feature to plan when to complete tasks.
- Include an achievement system based around successfully completing tasks. 
- Implement even more custom sounds for different intensity levels. 
- Add a social feature to share success with friends. 

**A message from TaskBully:**
Here at TaskBully, our vast team of 2 employees is deeply committed to the goal of replacing bullying with motivation. We are actively looking for sponsorships, investments, and growth opportunities until we can eventually eradicate procrastination.
